# chatMessenger
### Welcome Everyone!!


I have created a simple üí¨ Chat Messenger using networking libraries of Java. For the front end I have used JFrame class of Applets.

## Usage
### 1. Compile the `TestServer.java` and `ClientTest.java` by `javac` compiler. 
On Server Machine:
```shell
javac TestServer.java
```
On Client Machine:
```shell
javac ClientTest.java
```

### 2. Run the compiled `TestServer.class` and `ClientTest.class` files.
On Server Machine:
```shell
java TestServer
```
You will have server window opened which starts listening for connections on port 1234.



On Client Machine:
```shell
java ClientTest
```
Connection will be established if no error is thrown and client window will popup.
Communication can be done now!


### Note
Maximum number of clients that can connect to the server at a time = 100


## Happy Chatting ‚ô•Ô∏è
